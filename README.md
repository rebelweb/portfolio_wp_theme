# Portfolio Wordpress Theme

This is the theme to my portfolio website. The theme uses webpack to include and build assets.

## Development

The following is required to develop this theme.

- Node (NPM)
- A working wordpress install

## Development with Docker

A __docker-compose.yml__ file is include to quickly set up a test environment. This sets up a wordpress environment
in docker, along with the accompanying mysql database. The compose file links the project directory as a volume
so you can see you changes directly.
